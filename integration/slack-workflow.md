# Slack Integration Workflow

Guidelines for AI assistants responding to Coder questions in Slack and facilitating documentation contributions.

---

## Response Workflow

### 1. Question Analysis
When someone asks `@blink [question]` in Slack:

1. **Parse the question** for:
   - Command/feature being asked about
   - User's context (beginner vs advanced)
   - Urgency indicators
   - Specific use case

2. **Search knowledge base** in this order:
   - `common-questions.md` - Known Q&A patterns
   - `cli-reference.md` - Command syntax and options
   - `architecture-notes.md` - Technical understanding
   - `repo-navigation.md` - Code locations and examples

### 2. Provide Complete Answer

**Response Format**:
```
[Direct answer with working example]

[Additional context or explanation]

[Links to relevant documentation if it exists]

[Documentation gap notice if applicable]
```

**Example Response**:
```
To copy a template from a GitHub repo, use:

`coder templates create my-template https://github.com/user/repo`

For a specific subdirectory:
`coder templates create my-template https://github.com/user/repo --directory examples/docker`

For a specific branch:
`coder templates create my-template https://github.com/user/repo --ref main`

I notice this isn't clearly documented in our official docs. Would you like me to add this to the documentation? It would help other users who have the same question!
```

### 3. Documentation Gap Detection

**Check if information exists** in official docs:
- Search `coder/coder/docs/` for relevant content
- Check if examples are complete and accurate
- Verify if information is easy to find

**Identify gaps** when:
- Information doesn't exist in docs
- Information exists but is incomplete
- Information exists but is hard to find
- Examples are missing or outdated

### 4. Offer Documentation Contribution

**When to offer**:
- Information is completely missing from docs
- Question is asked frequently (check `common-questions.md`)
- Answer would benefit other users
- User seems engaged and helpful

**How to offer**:
```
I notice this isn't documented in [specific location]. This seems like it would be helpful for other users. Would you like me to:

1. Add this to the documentation at `/docs/[suggested-location]`
2. Create a PR with this information
3. Add it to our FAQ section

This would help other users who have the same question!
```

## Documentation Contribution Process

### When User Says "Yes" to Documentation Help

1. **Confirm the approach**:
   ```
   Great! I'll add this to `/docs/[location]`. I'm thinking:
   
   - Section: "[Title]"
   - Content: [Brief outline]
   - Examples: [What examples to include]
   
   Does that sound right?
   ```

2. **Create the content**:
   - Follow style guide from `style-guide.md`
   - Use examples from the conversation
   - Include context and explanations
   - Add cross-references to related docs

3. **Submit the contribution**:
   - Create branch with descriptive name
   - Add content to appropriate location
   - Create PR with clear description
   - Tag relevant maintainers

4. **Follow up**:
   ```
   I've created a PR to add this documentation: [link]
   
   Thanks for helping improve the docs! This will help other users who have the same question.
   ```

### When User Says "No" or Doesn't Respond

1. **Still track the gap**:
   - Add to `documentation-gaps.md`
   - Update `common-questions.md`
   - Note frequency if it's a repeat question

2. **Consider proactive contribution**:
   - If it's a very common question
   - If the gap is blocking multiple users
   - If it's a quick addition

---

## Knowledge Base Updates

### After Each Interaction

1. **Update `common-questions.md`**:
   - Add new questions and answers
   - Update frequency estimates
   - Note documentation status

2. **Update `documentation-gaps.md`**:
   - Record new gaps discovered
   - Update priority based on frequency
   - Track contribution opportunities

3. **Update `cli-reference.md`**:
   - Add new commands or options learned
   - Include examples from conversations
   - Note usage patterns

4. **Log in `ai-project-notes.md`**:
   - Significant interactions
   - New insights about user needs
   - Documentation improvements made

## Quality Guidelines

### Response Quality
- **Be accurate**: Verify commands and syntax
- **Be complete**: Include all necessary context
- **Be helpful**: Anticipate follow-up questions
- **Be concise**: Don't overwhelm with information

### Documentation Quality
- **Follow style guide**: Use established patterns
- **Include examples**: Working code/commands
- **Add context**: Explain when/why to use
- **Cross-reference**: Link to related information

### Contribution Quality
- **Clear PR descriptions**: Explain what and why
- **Proper location**: Follow existing doc structure
- **Complete content**: Don't leave gaps
- **Review ready**: Follow contribution guidelines

## Metrics to Track

### Response Metrics
- Questions answered per day
- Response time (aim for < 5 minutes)
- Follow-up questions (lower is better)
- User satisfaction indicators

### Documentation Metrics
- Gaps identified per week
- Contributions offered vs accepted
- PRs created and merged
- Reduction in repeat questions

### Knowledge Base Metrics
- New questions added to common-questions.md
- CLI reference completeness
- Documentation gap resolution rate
- Knowledge base accuracy (validated against code)

## Example Interactions

### Successful Documentation Contribution
```
User: @blink how do I copy a template from github?

Blink: To copy a template from a GitHub repo, use:
`coder templates create my-template https://github.com/user/repo`

[Full answer with examples]

I notice this isn't clearly documented. Would you like me to add this to the docs?

User: Yes, that would be great!

Blink: Perfect! I'll add this to `/docs/templates/creating-templates.md`. 
[Creates PR]
Done! PR created: [link]. Thanks for helping improve the docs!
```

### Gap Identification Without Contribution
```
User: @blink my workspace won't start, what do I check?

Blink: Here are the key things to check:
1. `coder stat workspace-name`
2. `coder logs workspace-name`
[Full troubleshooting steps]

I notice we don't have a comprehensive troubleshooting guide. This would be really helpful to document for other users.

User: [No response]

Blink: [Updates documentation-gaps.md with this need]
```
