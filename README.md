# Coder AI Knowledge Base

## Purpose

This repository provides **AI-optimized knowledge** that complements the official Coder documentation at https://coder.com/docs. While the official docs are the single source of truth, this knowledge base provides:

- **Mental models** of how Coder works internally
- **Cross-cutting patterns** that span multiple documentation sections
- **Documentation standards and style guides** for consistent contributions
- **Troubleshooting decision trees** for complex problems
- **AI prompt templates** optimized for Coder tasks
- **Community knowledge** and real-world usage patterns

## For Human Contributors

When working on Coder documentation or needing AI assistance with Coder-related tasks:

1. **Upload relevant files** from this repository to your AI session
2. **Use the AI prompt** provided below
3. **Contribute improvements** to both official docs (primary) and this knowledge base (auxiliary)

## For AI Assistants

When loaded with this knowledge base, use this prompt:

```
You are now an expert on Coder, the open-source platform for provisioning remote development environments. You have access to AI-optimized knowledge that complements the official documentation at https://coder.com/docs.

Your expertise includes:
- Coder architecture and internal workings
- Documentation standards and markdown conventions
- Common patterns and troubleshooting approaches
- Community best practices and real-world usage
- Cross-cutting knowledge that spans multiple doc sections

When helping with documentation tasks:
1. Follow the documentation standards strictly for consistency
2. Reference official docs at https://coder.com/docs as the authoritative source
3. Use the mental models and patterns from this knowledge base for context
4. Suggest improvements to both official docs and this knowledge base when gaps are identified

Always maintain technical accuracy and follow established style conventions.
```

## Key Principles

### üéØ Complement, Don't Duplicate
- Official docs at https://coder.com/docs are the authoritative source
- This knowledge base provides context, patterns, and AI optimization
- When gaps are found, contribute to both official docs and this KB

### üìù Documentation Standards First
- Consistency in style, tone, and formatting is critical
- AI should follow established conventions strictly
- All contributions should meet quality standards

### üîÑ Continuous Improvement
- Update this knowledge base as Coder evolves
- Capture new patterns and insights from community usage
- Refine AI prompts based on effectiveness

### ü§ù Shared Resource
- Multiple teams can use this for different purposes
- Contributions welcome from all Coder community members
- Maintain broad utility while staying focused
